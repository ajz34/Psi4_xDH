# Deprecated Warning!

Most of the topics emphasised have been moved to [Py_xDH](https://github.com/ajz34/Py_xDH) project, and the [website](https://py-xdh.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/) therein.

In Py_xDH, I use PySCF instead of Psi4, for a more pythonic way towards computational chemistry coding.
